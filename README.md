# mevn_cli

Testing the MEVN cli. Working to add a form on the client that adds name and position to the backend api, that way I can display them on the front end later.  Currently having an issue in client/components/manager.vue with the addNewUsers().  It's supposed to be usig axios to do a post to /api, but the alert modal I setup is popping up with "Something went wrong" when I submit a new user in the form.
